# neural-data-analysis

Neuroscience has made remarkable strides in recent years, driven by technological advances that have allowed it to collect vast amounts of neural data. However, the analysis of this data presents challenges, requiring specialized tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights.
This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts designed to address these challenges. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and flexible toolkit for researchers and developers to analyze neural data types.
The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy for users to navigate and understand. This project is intended to be a collaborative effort, with contributions from the research community encouraged and welcomed. 
The neural data analysis repository is a valuable resource for researchers and developers in neuroscience, providing a powerful and flexible toolkit for analyzing complex neural data.
