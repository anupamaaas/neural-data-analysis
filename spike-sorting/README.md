## Processing Neural Activity: Spike Sorting

Spike sorting is a critical step in analyzing extracellular neural recordings. Due to the presence of various sources of noise, detecting and separating the spikes of individual neurons from the recorded signals is essential for accurately determining the firing rates and patterns of different neurons. The ability to identify different neurons and their firing patterns is crucial for understanding brain function and developing treatments for neurological disorders. Various methods and algorithms have been developed for spike sorting, including template matching, principal component analysis, and clustering techniques (Harris et al., 2016; Lewicki, 1998; Quiroga et al., 2004). The accuracy of spike sorting can have a significant impact on the interpretation of experimental results, and it is therefore an important area of research in neuroscience.
