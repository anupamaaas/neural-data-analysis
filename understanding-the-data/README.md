## Understanding the Neural Data

Extracellular neural recordings are a type of electrophysiological data that measures the activity of many neurons in a small region of the brain. These recordings are often noisy and complex, and require specialized analysis techniques to extract meaningful information.

One common technique to analyze extracellular neural data is to use a bandpass filter, which selectively attenuates frequencies outside a specific range of interest. By applying a bandpass filter, researchers can remove unwanted noise and artifacts, enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and highlight specific features of the neural activity, such as spikes or oscillations.

The MATLAB file in this folder provide a simple and accessible introduction to the use of bandpass filtering for extracellular neural data analysis.
